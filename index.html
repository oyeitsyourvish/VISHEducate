            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                1) Education is normally regarded as a "public consumption" item, provided in many instances free of
                charge or at prices not reflecting the costs of producing it. Government spending has thus remained the
                main source of educational funding in most countries. In 1994, OECD countries as a whole spent 5.9 per
                cent of their collective GDP on education, 80 per cent of which was devoted to direct public expenditure
                on educational institutions. For most OECD countries, education represents between 10 and 15 per cent of
                total government outlays. A recent study (1997) concludes that expenditure on education per student
                tends to be higher for richer countries than for poorer countries in the OECD area, even when
                controlling for differences in national income levels.
                Education also exists as a "private consumption" item with a price determined freely by the providing
                institutions. Private sector expenditure on educational institutions reveals significant variations
                among OECD countries, ranging from 2 per cent or below of total expenditure on education in Portugal,
                Sweden and Turkey, to over 22 per cent in Germany, Japan, Korea and the United States. Private sector
                expenditure is particularly significant at the tertiary level of education amounting, for instance, to
                over half of total private expenditure on education in Japan, Korea and the United States.
                It is important to bear in mind that cross-country disparities in expenditure levels may not only
                reflect different policy priorities, but a variety of economic, social and demographic factors. On the
                supply side, the primary factor determining total expenditure on education is staff salaries. Dominated
                by the pay of teachers, staff salaries account for over four fifths of current expenditures at the
                primary and secondary level in OECD countries, ranging from just under 65 per cent in the Czech Republic
                and Sweden to over 90 per cent in Greece, Italy, Portugal and Turkey. Different models of education may
                also have very different spending implications. For instance, high-expenditure countries may be
                enrolling large numbers of students while low-expenditure countries may be more focused and selective.
                On the demand side, overall enrolment levels are determined mainly by the size of the youth population
                and participation rates. In other words, the larger the size of the population between ages 5 and 29,
                the more a country can be expected to spend on education</p>
